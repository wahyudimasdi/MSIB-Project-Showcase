## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have worked on during my academic career and internships. These projects demonstrate my skills and expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. 

## Project Highlights
This portfolio includes projects on a variety of topics, including:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews from Google Play Store to determine sentiment.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict housing prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive visualizations using Python and Tableau.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing EDA on various datasets to uncover insights and trends.

## Features
- **Detailed Documentation**: Each project comes with a comprehensive README file explaining the project goals, methodologies, and results.
- **Reproducible Code**: The code for each project is well-documented and can be easily run and modified.
- **Visualizations**: Includes a variety of data visualizations to illustrate findings.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Many projects include Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive experience.

## Installation
To explore the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/data-science-portfolio.git
   cd data-science-portfolio
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:::
   '''bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies:
   '''bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Navigate to Project Directory:
   Each project is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the desired project:
   ''' bash
   cd project_name
2. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   Most projects include Jupyter Notebooks. Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and results interactively:
   '''bash
   jupyter notebook
3. Execute Scripts:
   Some projects include standalone scripts. Follow the instructions in the project README to run these scripts.

## Project Descriptions
